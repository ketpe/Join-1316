                        <p>Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use <span class="join-spezial-text-color">Join</span>:
                        </p>

                        <ol class="help-list">
                            <li>
                                <h3 class="join-h3">Exploring the Board</h3>
                                <p>
                                    When you log in to <span class="join-spezial-text-color">Join</span>, you'll find a
                                    default board.
                                    This board represents your project and contains four default lists: "To Do", "In
                                    Progress", “Await feedback” and "Done".
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h3 class="join-h3">Creating Contacts</h3>
                                <p>In <span class="join-spezial-text-color">Join</span>, you can add contacts to
                                    collaborate on your projects.
                                    Go to the "Contacts" section, click on "New contact", and fill in the required
                                    information.
                                    Once added, these contacts can be assigned tasks and they can interact with the
                                    tasks on the board.
                                </p>
                            </li>

                                <h3 class="join-h3">Adding Cards</h3>
                                <p>Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards.
                                    Cards represent individual tasks. Click the "+" button under the appropriate list to
                                    create a new card.
                                    Fill in the task details in the card, like task name, description, due date,
                                    assignees, etc.
                                </p>
                            </li>

                                <h3 class="join-h3">Moving Cards</h3>
                                <p>As the task moves from one stage to another,
                                    you can reflect that on the board by dragging and dropping the card from one list to
                                    another.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h3 class="join-h3">Deleting Cards</h3>
                                <p>Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done" list or delete it.
                                    Deleting a card will permanently remove it from the board.
                                    Please exercise caution when deleting cards, as this action is irreversible.
                                </p>
                                <p>Remember that using Join effectively requires consistent updates from you and your
                                    team to ensure the board reflects the current state of your project.</p>
